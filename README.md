# Speech Digit Recognition System 🗣️🔢

This project implements a speech digit recognition system that recognizes spoken digits from 0 to 9. The system is built from scratch using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) for feature extraction. The project uses cepstral coefficients and the Durbin algorithm for HMM parameter estimation.

## Overview 🎯

The system processes speech data to recognize digits by:
1. Normalizing the audio data.
2. Extracting features using Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and Cepstral Coefficients.
3. Training a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each digit.
4. Recognizing the spoken digit based on the trained models.

## Detailed Explanation 📖

### Normalization and Feature Extraction 🔧

- **Normalization:** The audio data is normalized by removing the DC offset and scaling the amplitude to a predefined range. 🎚️
- **Feature Extraction:** The system uses Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) to calculate the reflection coefficients, which are then transformed into Cepstral Coefficients. These coefficients represent the speech signal in a compact form. 📊

### Universe Creation 🌌

The universe is a collection of feature vectors extracted from training samples. The system processes multiple audio files, normalizes them, and extracts cepstral coefficients, which are stored in a CSV file. 🗃️

### Codebook Generation 📘

The Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm is applied to the universe to generate a codebook. The codebook is a quantized representation of the feature space, which reduces the complexity of HMM training. 🛠️

### Hidden Markov Model Training 📚

Each digit is modeled using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The system initializes the HMM parameters and uses the extracted features to train the models. The training process involves calculating forward and backward probabilities (Alpha and Beta) and updating the HMM parameters. 🔄

### Recognition 🏆

The recognition process involves calculating the probability of the observed sequence given each HMM model. The model with the highest probability is chosen as the recognized digit. 🎯
