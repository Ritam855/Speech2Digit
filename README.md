üé§ Digit Recognition using Hidden Markov Models and LPC
Welcome to the Digit Recognition project! This project implements a system that recognizes spoken digits (0-9) using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) features. The system is built entirely from scratch in C++ and processes speech data through several stages, including data normalization, feature extraction, and training a model for digit recognition.

üìÇ Project Structure
The project is divided into several key sections:

Universe Creation:

Normalize data, calculate Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) coefficients, and transform them into Cepstral Coefficients.
Apply LBG Algorithm to create a codebook for feature vector quantization.
HMM Training:

Initialize HMM parameters.
Use the Baum-Welch algorithm for parameter estimation.
Train models for each digit.
Recognition:

Apply the Viterbi algorithm to recognize digits from the input speech data.
